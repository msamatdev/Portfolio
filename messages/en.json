One of them came up with an idea: he had a spare laptop that is powerful enough to run multiple servers at the same time, and I had the knowledge to host game servers on it. So, we agreed that he would provide the laptop, and that I would be the one configuring the machine and the servers.",
                "p2": "Firstly, I had to pick an operating system. I chose Linux over Windows because I had enough experience to make servers on it, and Linux is more lightweight than Windows so our game servers could have more resources allocated. For instance, Windows uses more than 4GB of RAM on idle whereas a lightweight distribution of Linux uses less than 2GB.",
                "p3": "I decided to install Ubuntu: I had already used it, and I knew that there was an option during its installation to only install the necessary packages to make it as lightweight as possible. I hesitated a bit between Ubuntu 22 and Ubuntu server, but Ubuntu server does not have a user interface, and I didn't know if I would be able to do everything with no user interface. Therefore, I picked Ubuntu 22.",
                "p4": "To install Linux on the laptop, I had to make a bootable USB drive. In order to do it, I installed Rufus on my computer. It is a tool specifically made for creating bootable USB drives. I downloaded the optical disk image (iso) of the latest version of Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, and I used Rufus to create the Linux Bootable USB drive easily.",
                "p5": "I plugged the USB key in the laptop and I chose it as the first boot option in the BIOS. Then, I followed the installation process. After installing Linux, I was worried about the security of the machine since it would read all the requests coming from specific ports. That is why I started to make the machine safer. I created a new user withoutthe root privileges, I installed a firewall and fail2ban, and I made sure SSH was disabled (I would use a remote desktop application to log on the computer when I would need to).",
                "p6": "All that remained was to host the servers. Over the course of two years, I created and took care of a diverse range of servers across various video games: Minecraft, Space Engineers, ARK, Garry's Mod, BeamMP, Unturned, and many more. Although I did not talk about it in more details, I had to do port-forwarding for every server, otherwise we could not access it remotely.",
                "p7": "To this day, the machine is still hosting several servers. Although I don't have a lot of time to play with my friends anymore, I still make new servers for them sometimes when I can, and I make sure that the ones that are running are always up to date.",
                "p8": "My friends and I were facing a problem: we could not play several video games together because renting servers would cost us money. We made a brainstorming and we found a solution: to host our own servers. Being skilled enough to do that, I have been the one setting up the machine and creating and managing the servers. It allowed me to gain knowledge about Linux, the way a network works, how to secure a machine, and how to host servers in general."

I am proud that I managed to create an entire modern website using a framework, and on my own. I also hope that it will help me find an apprenticeship, since it shows what I am capable of in web development.",

                "p4": "To create my own website, I needed to decide which tools I would pick. Should I go with the regular stack consisting of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a static website? Should I use a framework? If so, which one?",
                "p5": "Since I already developed some static websites, I wanted to try something different. Moreover, a framework comes with many advantages: it allows you to  dynamically generate pages, create reusable components, have clean links that do not end in .html, etc. So, I decided that I would learn a framework... but which one ?",
                "p6": "After doing some research, I found Next.js. I chose it because I find it very appealing. Indeed, its app router and the fact that we can do frontend and backend makes it a solid framework. Moreover, it is a react framework, which is a framework that is used by many huge companies. Consequently, learning Next.js means learning some parts of react as well, which is a strong advantage too.",

                "p7-2": "At this time, it was only containing the files related to the framework. There was nothing, except a blank page.",
                "p8": "I planified the realization of the project, by writing in a text file every step. I tried my best to have a clear vision of the result before writing any line of code. Thanks to that, I have always been organized when working on it: I knew what to do, and in which order.",
                "p9": "Everything was planified and set-up, I was finally ready to write the code. I started by making the home page. I was slow though: I was discovering  Tailwind CSS and TypeScript, so it took me some time to get used to it.",
                "p10": "At the same time, I started to work on the navigation bar. It was truly difficult for me because I needed to make some complex actions like changing the color of the name of the page in the navigation bar when you are on it. I also had to hide and show the menu with a button when you are accessing the website  on a mobile phone.",
                "p11": "When I was working on the menu of the bar for mobile users, I encountered a strange problem: for some reason, I couldn't animate the height of the navigation bar. The animation simply did not work and the menu just popped when you pressed the button. I learnt after some time that it was caused by Tailwind, and that you need to use a specific height instead of the automatic height because it won't workotherwise.",
                "p12": "Coding the other pages has made me learn a lot too. I have created components that takes arguments, I have used some React tools like the hooks and the map function, and I even learnt some backend by creating an api that works with the  form in the 'contact' page and that sends me a message.",
                "p13": "Overall, it has been a nice experience for me to work on this website. I learnt a lot by trying my first framework, discovering Tailwind CSS, and  making my first working form.  I also discovered how a DNS works by purchasing my domain name and affecting the subdomain  'portfolio' to this site. I encountered a lot of problems but I solved them one by one while  staying motivated. It took me more than two months but now my biggest project to this date is functional",
