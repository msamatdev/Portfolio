## Overview

This is my portfolio made with NextJS to, hopefully, find a 2-year apprentice-ship program near Paris.

## Starting the app

<ol>
    <li>Execute <code>npm i</code> in your console to install the required packages to run the app.</li>
    <li>
        Create a .env.local file, containing the environment variables <code>RESEND_API_KEY</code>, which will be your Resend key in order to send mails,
        and <code>TO_EMAIL</code> which will contain your email to be able to receive the messages sent on the website.
    </li>
    <li>You can then start it like every Next.js app with <code>npm run dev</code></li>
</ol>
