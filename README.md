## Overview

This is my portfolio made with NextJS to, hopefully, find a 2-year apprentice-ship program near Paris.

Lucide-icons has been used for the icons, and React-TypeAnimation has been used for the animation in the home page.

## Starting the app

You can start it like every Next app with ```npm run dev```
